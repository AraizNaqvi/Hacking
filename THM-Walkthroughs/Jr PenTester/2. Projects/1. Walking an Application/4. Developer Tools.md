Upon Inspecting the website, we are able to manipulate CSS. This is where I will use it to view hidden content on the news page > article 3 which requires a paid subscription to view.

Looking at the CSS for the pay-wall:
```
div.premium-customer-blocker {
1. [ ]  display: block;
2. [ ]  position: absolute;
3. [ ]  top: 0;
4. [ ]  left: 0;
5. [ ]  margin-top: 60px;
6. [ ]  width: 100%;
7. [ ]  height: 100%;
8. [ ]  background-color: #FFF;
9. [ ]  border: 2px solid #000;
10. [ ]  text-align: center;
}
```

Let's try to make `display:none`. And, voila! The wall disappears revealing the flag.
Flag: `THM{NOT_SO_HIDDEN}`

Next, upon going through the website as soon as you enter the contacts page, there is a red flash that appears for a brief second and disappers. Let's look into this.
If we go to the sources > flash.min.js, after looking we see this peice of code that says:
```
setTimeout(function() {
    flash['remove']();
}, 0x5);
```

This is what is responsible for making that red flash disappear. Now, if I add a breaking point by clicking on line number and refresh the page, voila! There's the flag.
Flag: `THM{CATCH_ME_IF_YOU_CAN}`

Furthermore, if we send a contact us request by submitting the form, in the networks tab we can see that a `contacts.msg` is displayed which upon clicking seems to be coming from a subdomain `https://10-10-205-241.p.thmlabs.com/contact-msg` which returns:
```
{"msg":"Message Received","flag":"THM{GOT_AJAX_FLAG}"}
```

Flag: `THM{GOT_AJAX_FLAG}`
