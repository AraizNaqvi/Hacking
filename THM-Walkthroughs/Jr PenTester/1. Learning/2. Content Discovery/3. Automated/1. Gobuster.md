As a beginner, learning **Gobuster** can be simple and effective for discovering hidden directories and files on a web server. Follow this beginner-friendly guide to start using Gobuster step-by-step:

---

### **Step 1: Install Gobuster**

If you haven't already, install Gobuster. On Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gobuster
```

---

### **Step 2: Understand the Basics**

**Gobuster** works by:

1. Sending HTTP requests to the target.
2. Checking if common directories or files from a wordlist exist on the web server.

Think of it as testing a locked door to see which keys work.

---

### **Step 3: Choose a Wordlist**

Wordlists contain the "keys" (directory/file names) Gobuster tries.

Use **SecLists** (installed with `sudo apt install seclists`):

- Common wordlist for directories:  
    `/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt`
- Medium-sized wordlist:  
    `/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`

---

### **Step 4: Basic Gobuster Command**

Run Gobuster to find directories on a website:

#### **Command**:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
```

#### **Explanation**:

- `dir`: Mode for finding directories/files.
- `-u http://example.com`: Target website URL.
- `-w /path/to/wordlist`: Path to the wordlist you're using.

---

### **Step 5: Read the Results**

As Gobuster runs, you'll see:

- **Status 200**: A valid directory or file.
- **Status 403**: Forbidden (exists but access is restricted).
- **Status 404**: Not found (skipped).

Example:

```
/admin (Status: 200)
/login (Status: 200)
/backup (Status: 403)
```

---

### **Step 6: Focus Your Scan**

Once you see interesting results, you can refine your scan:

#### **Add File Extensions**

If the target uses `.php`, `.html`, or `.txt` files:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -x php,html,txt
```

#### **Limit to Specific Status Codes**

To focus on successful hits:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -s "200,403"
```

#### **Use HTTPS with Invalid Certificates**

If the target has SSL errors:

```bash
gobuster dir -u https://example.com -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -k
```

---

### **Step 7: Save Results to a File**

Save output for later review:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -o results.txt
```

---

### **Step 8: Examples for Common Scenarios**

#### **1. Finding Admin Panels**

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
```

#### **2. Searching for Backup Files**

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x zip,tar,gz,sql
```

#### **3. API Endpoint Discovery**

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://example.com/api -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/api-endpoints.txt
```

---

### **Step 9: Analyze and Use Results**

Once Gobuster finds something:

1. **Visit the directories/files**: Check if they lead to sensitive data or login pages.
2. **Investigate further**:
    - For `403 Forbidden` responses, explore bypass techniques (e.g., altering headers).
    - Download files like `.zip` or `.sql` if accessible.

---

### **Pro Tips for Beginners**

1. **Start Small**: Use the `common.txt` wordlist for quick results before moving to larger wordlists.
    
2. **Experiment Safely**: Use intentionally vulnerable environments like:
    
    - [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/)
    - [DVWA](http://www.dvwa.co.uk/)
3. **Avoid Detection**:
    
    - Use smaller thread counts (`-t 10`) to avoid triggering web server defenses.
    
    ```bash
    gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w /path/to/wordlist -t 10
    ```
    
4. **Combine Tools**: Use Gobuster results with tools like **Burp Suite** or **Nikto** to dig deeper.
