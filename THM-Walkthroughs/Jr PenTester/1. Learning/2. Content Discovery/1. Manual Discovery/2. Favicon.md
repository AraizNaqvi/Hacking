A Favicon is the small icon you see on the browser tab which denotes a website logo or branding.

Sometimes when frameworks are used to build a website, the default favicon that comes with the framework is left over if the owner does replace it with custom favicons.
This can give us a clue of what framework was used.

OWASP hosts a database of commonly used Framework Icons which you can compare against [here](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database).
