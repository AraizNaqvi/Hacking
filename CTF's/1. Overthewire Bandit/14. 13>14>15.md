# Bandit Level 13 → Level 14

## Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in **/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14**. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. **Note:** **localhost** is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.

**Thought Process**:
There is a private key given which I can use as my key into connecting with bandit14 server. Once that was done, I see this path that the objective says that password is found here, so i'm simply going to read what that file has. And voila! It is the password to level 14. Next, as I moved to level 14 as it said I tried to connect to localhost at port 30000 wherein there was no response, so I just pasted the password I just got and it responded with a new password. This new password would get me into level 15.


**Steps**:

1. Firstly list all items in the directory using the `ls -lsh` command:
```
bandit13@bandit:~$ ls -lsh
total 4.0K
4.0K -rw-r----- 1 bandit14 bandit13 1.7K Sep 19 07:08 sshkey.private
```

2. Use this private key with the `ssh` command followed by `-i` flag:
```
bandit13@bandit:~$ ssh -i sshkey.private -p 2220 bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
The authenticity of host '[bandit.labs.overthewire.org]:2220 ([127.0.0.1]:2220)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:C2ihUBV7ihnV1wUXRb4RrEcLfXC5CXlhmAAM/urerLY.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Could not create directory '/home/bandit13/.ssh' (Permission denied).
Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/home/bandit13/.ssh/known_hosts).

Welcome to OverTheWire!
bandit14@bandit:~$
```

3. Reading file in the directory mentioned in the objective using the `cat` command:
```
bandit14@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS
```

4. Current password was submitted to `localhost` at port `30000` using `nc` command:
```
bandit14@bandit:~$ nc localhost 30000
MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS
Correct!

```

*Just to clear doubts, when you do bandit15@bandit.org stuff then put this password it should take you to Level 15: 8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo*
