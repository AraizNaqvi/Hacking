### Bandit Level 3 âž” Level 4

**Description**:
The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the **inhere** directory.

**Thought Process:**
First of all simply check content of the inhere file, upon which nothing comes up. Means there can be hidden files in it. So, after listing directory including all hidden files, I finally get a file named ...Hiding-From-You which once again needs an escape character sequence to be able to read through.


**Steps**:

1. Firstly list all items including the hidden ones using the `ls` command:
```
bandit3@bandit:~$ ls -lash inhere
total 12K
4.0K drwxr-xr-x 2 root    root    4.0K Sep 19 07:08 .
4.0K drwxr-xr-x 3 root    root    4.0K Sep 19 07:08 ..
4.0K -rw-r----- 1 bandit4 bandit3   33 Sep 19 07:08 ...Hiding-From-You
```

2. We can now simply `cat` the content of the `...Hiding-From-You` file directly as:
```
bandit3@bandit:~$ ls -lash inhere
total 12K
4.0K drwxr-xr-x 2 root    root    4.0K Sep 19 07:08 .
4.0K drwxr-xr-x 3 root    root    4.0K Sep 19 07:08 ..
4.0K -rw-r----- 1 bandit4 bandit3   33 Sep 19 07:08 ...Hiding-From-You
```
