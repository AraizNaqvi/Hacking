## Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** next to the word **millionth**

**Thought Process:**
The first step always is what the hell is even in the files. Since there was a `txt` and i've to find word `'millionth'` i'm going to `grep` along with the `strings`.


**Steps**:

1. Firstly list all items in the directory using the `ls -lsh`  as well as `ls -lash` command:
```
bandit7@bandit:~$ ls -lsh
total 4.0M
4.0M -rw-r----- 1 bandit8 bandit7 4.0M Sep 19 07:08 data.txt
```

2. Since `data.txt` is a String file, we can use `strings` command to read the file then pass it on to `grep` to find "millionth" using the `pipe` command:
```
bandit7@bandit:~$ strings data.txt | grep "millionth"
millionth	dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc
```
