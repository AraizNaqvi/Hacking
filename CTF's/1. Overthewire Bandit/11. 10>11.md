# Bandit Level 10 â†’ Level 11

### Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data

**Thought Process**:
I want to first understand what kind of file it is by using `file` command, then I will simply go and decode it.


**Steps**:

1. Firstly list all items in the directory using the `ls -lsh` command:
```
bandit10@bandit:~$ ls -lsh
total 4.0K
4.0K -rw-r----- 1 bandit11 bandit10 69 Sep 19 07:08 data.txt
```

2. Use file command to understand what kind of data that file holds (I forgot to add this snippet, output may vary but you should see base64 somewhere in the output XD):
```
bandit10@bandit:~$ file data.txt
data.txt: base64
```

4. Upon using `cat` command to see the data, it seems to be a Base64 encryption:
```
bandit10@bandit:~$ cat data.txt
VGhlIHBhc3N3b3JkIGlzIGR0UjE3M2ZaS2IwUlJzREZTR3NnMlJXbnBOVmozcVJyCg==
```

3. Decoding the base64 by using `base64` command followed by `-d` flag on `data.txt` to get the password:
```
bandit10@bandit:~$ base64 -d data.txt
The password is dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr
```
