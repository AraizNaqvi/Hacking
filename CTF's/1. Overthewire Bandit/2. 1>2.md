### Bandit Level 1 âž” Level 2

**Description**:
The password for the next level is stored in a file called **-** located in the home directory

**Thought Process:**
So clearly the '-' file pings my mind saying that's an odd name I will need to use an escape character to execute it.

**Steps**:

1. Once connected use the `ls` command to list all files:
```
bandit1@bandit:~$ ls -lsh
total 4.0K
4.0K -rw-r----- 1 bandit2 bandit1 33 Sep 19 07:08 -
```

2. Now you can execute the file using `cat` command as:
```
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ./-
