### Bandit Level 4 ➔ Level 5

**Description**:
The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the **inhere** directory. Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

**Thought Process:**
First of all always look at the files present. Upon assessing, there are a bunch of files within the `inhere` directory. A file will be human readable if it is an `ASCII` type. So, I thought I need to check the file type of each of the files in the inhere.
Which was done via the `find` and `file` commands.


**Steps**:

1. Firstly list all items in the `inhere` directory using the `ls` command:
```
bandit4@bandit:~$ ls -lsh
total 4.0K
4.0K drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4.0K Sep 19 07:08 inhere
```

2. Use the `find` command to find within the current directory a `file` type and display its content type as:
```
bandit4@bandit:~$ find . -type f | xargs file
./inhere/-file08: data
./inhere/-file02: data
./inhere/-file09: data
./inhere/-file01: data
./inhere/-file00: data
./inhere/-file05: data
./inhere/-file07: ASCII text
./inhere/-file03: data
./inhere/-file06: data
./inhere/-file04: data
./.profile:       ASCII text
./.bashrc:        ASCII text
./.bash_logout:   ASCII text
```

3. Clearly, `-file07` in the `inhere` directory has an `ASCII` type which is human readable hence we cat it as:
```
bandit4@bandit:~$ cat ./inhere/-file07
