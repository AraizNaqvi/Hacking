# Bandit Level 19 â†’ Level 20

## Level Goal

To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.


**Thought Process**:
Setuid is used to execute files with the owner permission so I will execute the file and run commands simultaneously.


**Steps**:

1. Firstly list all items in the directory using the `ls -lsh` command:
```
bandit19@bandit:~$ ls -lsh
total 16K
16K -rwsr-x--- 1 bandit20 bandit19 15K Sep 19 07:08 bandit20-do
```

2. Executing the Setuid file with listing files in the given /etc/bandit_pass:
```
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do ls /etc/bandit_pass
bandit0   bandit12  bandit16  bandit2	bandit23  bandit27  bandit30  bandit4  bandit8
bandit1   bandit13  bandit17  bandit20	bandit24  bandit28  bandit31  bandit5  bandit9
bandit10  bandit14  bandit18  bandit21	bandit25  bandit29  bandit32  bandit6
bandit11  bandit15  bandit19  bandit22	bandit26  bandit3   bandit33  bandit7
```

3. List content of the bandit20 since this is bandit20:
```
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO
