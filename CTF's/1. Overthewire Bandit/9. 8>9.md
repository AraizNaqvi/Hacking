# Bandit Level 8 â†’ Level 9

## Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** and is the only line of text that occurs only once.

**Thought Process:**
I thought that whatever the text was needed to occur only once. First I started by sorting it which put all strings in a sorted manner. Next, From these sorted strings I only want to see the unique ones which displayed all strings once. From these I want only those which occur once of all times.


**Steps**:

1. Firstly list all items in the `inhere` directory using the `ls -lsh`  command:
```
ls -lsh
total 36K
36K -rw-r----- 1 bandit9 bandit8 33K Sep 19 07:08 data.txt
```

2. Now, I will sort strings, such that only unique elements that occur only once come along:
```
bandit8@bandit:~$ strings data.txt | sort | uniq -u
