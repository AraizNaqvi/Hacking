# Bandit Level 22 â†’ Level 23

## Level Goal

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler. Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

**NOTE:** Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.


**Thought Process**:
Basically what this shell script is doing is that its taking current user i.e. bandit22 and storing in myname, then in mytarget it stores `md5sum` hash of I am user bandit22 and delimits by splitting the string from the space and takes the 1st character.

Since the password is in /tmp/x where x is mytarget when myname is bandit23, so that's what I decide to do. Run the command with myname bandit23 which returns a hash. This hash goes in place of x in /tmp/x. This gives me the password.

So


**Steps**:

1. Firstly as it says there are `CRON` configuration files at `/etc/cron.d` we `cd` to there:
```
bandit22@bandit:~$ cd /etc/cron.d/
```

2. Listing all items inside using ls `command`:
```
bandit22@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ ls -lsh
total 24K
4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 120 Sep 19 07:08 cronjob_bandit22
4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 122 Sep 19 07:08 cronjob_bandit23
4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 120 Sep 19 07:08 cronjob_bandit24
4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 201 Apr  8  2024 e2scrub_all
4.0K -rwx------ 1 root root  52 Sep 19 07:10 otw-tmp-dir
4.0K -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 396 Jan  9  2024 sysstat
```

3. This time straight `cat` cronjob_bandit23:
```
bandit22@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat cronjob_bandit23
@reboot bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
```

4. Now `cat` the cronjob_bandit23.sh:
```
bandit22@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget
```

5. Replacing myname with `bandit23`, then running the same command:
```
bandit22@bandit:~$ echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
```

6. Now `cat` `/tmp` with this hash:
```
bandit22@bandit:~$ cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
0Zf11ioIjMVN551jX3CmStKLYqjk54Ga
```
