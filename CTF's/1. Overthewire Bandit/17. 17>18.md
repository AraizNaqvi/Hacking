# Bandit Level 17 → Level 18

## Level Goal

There are 2 files in the homedirectory: **passwords.old and passwords.new**. The password for the next level is in **passwords.new** and is the only line that has been changed between **passwords.old and passwords.new**

**NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19**


**Thought Process**:
Since only one line has been changed rest are the same means if I find the difference between the two I get the unique lines. This is what I do and qute right I get the passcode.


**Steps**:

1. Firstly list all items in the directory using the `ls -lsh` command:
```
bandit17@bandit:~$ ls -lsh
total 8.0K
4.0K -rw-r----- 1 bandit18 bandit17 3.3K Sep 19 07:08 passwords.new
4.0K -rw-r----- 1 bandit18 bandit17 3.3K Sep 19 07:08 passwords.old
```

2. Now using the `diff` command I will be able to get the difference in the two files:
```
bandit17@bandit:~$ diff passwords.new passwords.old 
42c42
< x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO
---
> ktfgBvpMzWKR5ENj26IbLGSblgUG9CzB
```

Since it says that password lies in `password.new` so the only difference is `x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO`, so this is the password.
