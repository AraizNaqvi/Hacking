### Bandit Level 0 âž” Level 1

**Description**:
The password for the next level is stored in a file called **readme** located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

**Thought Process:**
Retrieve the password for Level 1 by logging in to the server using SSH and the port specified, following which i'll simply cat the file present.

**Steps**:

1. Use the `SSH` command to connect:
   ```bash
   ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
   ```
2. Once logged in, use the `cat` command to read the file `readme`:
   ```bash
   cat readme
   ```
3. This displays the password for the next level.

**Output**:
```
