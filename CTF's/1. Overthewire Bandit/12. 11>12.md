# Bandit Level 11 â†’ Level 12

## Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions

**Thought Process**:
I want to first understand what kind of file it is by using `file` command, then I will simply go and decode it. But, in this case, it is given to us that it is a `ROT13` file which means each character has been rotated 13 steps. So, i'll simply go online to `cyberchef.io` and decrypt it.


**Steps**:

1. Firstly list all items in the directory using the `ls -lsh` command:
```
bandit11@bandit:~$ ls -lsh
total 4.0K
4.0K -rw-r----- 1 bandit12 bandit11 49 Sep 19 07:08 data.txt
```

2. Read the contents of the file using `cat` command:
```
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt
Gur cnffjbeq vf 7k16JArUVv5LxVuJfsSVdbbtaHGlw9D4
```

3. Try to identify the type of data that file holds by using the `file` command:
```
bandit11@bandit:~$ file data.txt
data.txt: ASCII text
```

4. Since it is given to us that the data is encrypted using `ROT13`, let's go to [cyberchef.io](https://cyberchef.io/#recipe=ROT13(true,true,false,13)&input=R3VyIGNuZmZqYmVxIHZmIDdrMTZKQXJVVnY1THhWdUpmc1NWZGJidGFIR2x3OUQ0Cg) to check it out:

The password is 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4
