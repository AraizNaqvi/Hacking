### Bandit Level 2 âž” Level 3

**Description**:
The password for the next level is stored in a file called **spaces in this filename** located in the home directory.

**Thought Process:**
Once again clearly there are spaces in the file name meaning once again a whole lot need of Escape Characters will be evident while cat'ng the file.


**Steps**:

1. Firstly list all items using the `ls` command:
```
ls -lsh
total 4.0K
4.0K -rw-r----- 1 bandit3 bandit2 33 Sep 19 07:08 spaces in this filename
```

2. Using `cat` command with Escape Character Sequence (`\`) we execute details of the files by using the spaces within the file name:
```
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat ./spaces\ in\ this\ filename
