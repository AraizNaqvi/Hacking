# Bandit Level 9 → Level 10

## Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.

**Thought Process:**
I simply need to find strings containing '=' signs, which is how I can go searching for them.
Then I will go through wherever I see '=' signs and what looks like the password, is it.


**Steps**:

1. Firstly list all items in the directory using the `ls -lsh`  as well as `ls -lash` command:
```
bandit9@bandit:~$ ls -lsh
total 20K
20K -rw-r----- 1 bandit10 bandit9 19K Sep 19 07:08 data.txt
```

2. Simply read all strings with `strings` command followed by `grep` command to get all strings containing `"="`:
```
bandit9@bandit:~$ strings data.txt | grep "="
}========== the
p\l=
;c<Q=.dEXU!

69}=
%"=Y
=tZ~07
D9========== FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey
N=~[!N
zA=?0j
```

Clearly, the password looks like `FGUW5ilLVJrxX9kMYMmlN4MgbpfMiqey`, even if i'm wrong I can come back and check for more. But, i'm correct.
