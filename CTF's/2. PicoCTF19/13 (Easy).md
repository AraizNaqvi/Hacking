**Description**:
Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is?Â `cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}`

**Hint**:
This can be solved online if you don't want to do it by hand!

**Thought Process:**
Its a ROT13 meaning that each letter is rotated by 13. Since the letters in the alphabet are also 26 and half of 26 is 13. This means the ROT13's decoding is ROT13 itself.

**Steps**:

1. Copy the encoding and simply put it into cyberchef.com's ROT13 decoding to get the output.
